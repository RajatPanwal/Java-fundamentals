static variable - 
- static make the variable common to all the object with same value(address) - shared by all objects
- static variable belongs to the class and not to the object, ie why it is called like this - Mobile.name = "Phone"

static method - 
- you can call a static method directly with the help of a class name.
- you can use a static variable in a static method, but cant use a non static var inside a static method - because - 
    non static var are related to object and static method belongs to the class and not confined to any object

OOPS
Encapsulation
- Encapsulation = hide data + control how it is changed.

Naming Convention
- class and interface - CalName
- variables and methods - marks, show()
- constants - PIE, BRAND

Inheritance
- syntax - 
    class ChildClass extends ParentClass
- java doesn't support multiple Inheritance to avoid ambiguity - if 2 parent classes has method with same name, child class 
    will be confused that from where it should inherit that method, so prevent this, java doesn't support multiple Inheritance
- super() - when B extends A, and object of B is created - it call constructor of B, but it also call default constructor of
    A - because every constructor in java has a method super() which is already there even if we don't write it - and this 
    super() method call the default constructor of parent(super) class.
- every class in java extends a Object class - (only the parent class, child class will automatically inherit it through parent class).
- this() - this method calls the default constructor of same class - and that default constructor will call the default constructor 
    of super class.

method overloading 
- same method name, different parameter list

method overriding
- when child and parent class both has method with same name - method of child class overrides method of parent class

Access Modifiers 
- public - if you want to access something outside the package - make it public.
- private - private variables can be used only in same class.
- default - can be accessed in same package.
- protected - accessible by - same package, child classes (even in other packages).

Polymorphism
- Same line of code — different output — depending on the object inside it.
- 2 types - 
    - 1. compile time - overloading
    - 2. run time - overriding

Dynamic Method Dispatch
- Java decides which overridden method to run at runtime based on the object — not the reference type
- class Animal {
    void sound() {
            System.out.println("Animal sound");
        }
    }
    class Dog extends Animal {
        void sound() {
            System.out.println("Dog barks");
        }
    }
    Animal a = new Dog();
    a.sound();
- O/P - Dog barks
- Because at runtime, Java looks at actual object → Dog - and dispatches Dog’s version.

Final
- variable - same as const in c++ and java, its value can not be changed.
- class - no one can extend that class.
- method - it can not be override in child class.

Abstract
- abstract means “incomplete on purpose.”
- It forces child classes to complete it.
- you cannot create an object of an abstract class
- it is compulsory to make the class abstract if we are creating an abstract method in it.
- but we don't need to have an abstract method in an abstract class compulsory.

Inner class
- An inner class is a class written inside another class.
-   // syntax to class inner class
        Outer.Inner obj2 = obj.new Inner();
- just like when we need to call a method, first we need to create an object for it first - similarly - to call an inner
    class, first we need to create an object of outer class.

Anonymous Inner Class
- It’s a one-time-use class with no name.
- You create it only to override something once and throw it away.
- it is used when we know, a child class is only created to extend a parent and override a function, which is used only once. - so
    why create a new class, just create an Anonymous class.

Interface
- An interface is a rule book.
- It says what a class must do, not how it does it.
- Java allows multiple inheritance ONLY via interface
- similar to abstract class
- method inside interface are - public abstract
- a class needs to implements(extend) that interface - and need to override(implement) the method in class - and if fail to override
    any method - then the class will also become an abstract class
- variables in interface are - final and static 

- class - class -> extends
- class - interface -> implements
- interface - interface -> extends

Enums
- a fixed list of allowed values.
- named constants
- enum is a class

Annotation
- An annotation is a label (metadata) that gives extra information about your code to the compiler or a framework.
- compiler helps us to check if we have made any bug.

Types of Interfaces
- 1. Normal Interface
    - An interface with more than one abstract method
    - interface Animal {
        void eat();
        void sleep();
    }
    - use it When you want to define multiple behaviors
- 2. Functional Interface
    - Functional Interface
    - @FunctionalInterface
    interface Calculator {
        int add(int a, int b);
    }
    - It forces the compiler to ensure you don’t add a second abstract method.
    - lambda expressions can only be used with FunctionalInterface.
- 3. Marker Interface
    - An interface with ZERO methods.
    - interface Serializable {
        }

Lambda Expression
- A lambda is a short way to write a method WITHOUT naming a class.
- before - 
    A obj = new A() {
        public void show() {
            System.out.println("IN SHOW");
        }
    };
- after - 
    A obj = () -> System.out.println("IN SHOW");
- Lambda works ONLY with functional interfaces (interfaces with ONE abstract method).
- Lambda = shortcut to implement a functional interface.

Exceptions
- you should always handle exceptions
- exceptions are runtime errors.
- checked - checked at compile time
- unchecked - checked at runtime
- we can create our own custom exception.

Throw
- throw is you saying: “Something is wrong RIGHT NOW.”
- its like you are not going directly to catch block, because it is not an exception - but its should go to
    catch block because it is causing some problem.
- we can use if statement here
- Used to actually create and throw an exception
- if(age < 18) {
    throw new IllegalArgumentException("Age must be >= 18");
    }

Throws
- throws is you saying: “I won’t handle this — YOU handle it.”

Finally
- code in finally will execute not matter what. - even if there is an exception

Thread
- A thread is a small unit of execution inside a program.
- Think like this:
    Program → full application
    Thread → a worker inside that application
- Single-threaded
    One task at a time
    Slow
    Blocking
- Multi-threaded
    Multiple tasks at once
    Faster
    Used in servers (Spring Boot)
