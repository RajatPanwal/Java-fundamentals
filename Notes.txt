static variable - 
- static make the variable common to all the object with same value(address) - shared by all objects
- static variable belongs to the class and not to the object, ie why it is called like this - Mobile.name = "Phone"

static method - 
- you can call a static method directly with the help of a class name.
- you can use a static variable in a static method, but cant use a non static var inside a static method - because - 
    non static var are related to object and static method belongs to the class and not confined to any object

OOPS
Encapsulation
- Encapsulation = hide data + control how it is changed.

Naming Convention
- class and interface - CalName
- variables and methods - marks, show()
- constants - PIE, BRAND

Inheritance
- syntax - 
    class ChildClass extends ParentClass
- java doesn't support multiple Inheritance to avoid ambiguity - if 2 parent classes has method with same name, child class 
    will be confused that from where it should inherit that method, so prevent this, java doesn't support multiple Inheritance
