static variable - 
- static make the variable common to all the object with same value(address) - shared by all objects
- static variable belongs to the class and not to the object, ie why it is called like this - Mobile.name = "Phone"

static method - 
- you can call a static method directly with the help of a class name.
- you can use a static variable in a static method, but cant use a non static var inside a static method - because - 
    non static var are related to object and static method belongs to the class and not confined to any object

OOPS
Encapsulation
- Encapsulation = hide data + control how it is changed.

Naming Convention
- class and interface - CalName
- variables and methods - marks, show()
- constants - PIE, BRAND

Inheritance
- syntax - 
    class ChildClass extends ParentClass
- java doesn't support multiple Inheritance to avoid ambiguity - if 2 parent classes has method with same name, child class 
    will be confused that from where it should inherit that method, so prevent this, java doesn't support multiple Inheritance
- super() - when B extends A, and object of B is created - it call constructor of B, but it also call default constructor of
     A - because every constructor in java has a method super() which is already there even if we don't write it - and this 
     super() method call the default constructor of parent(super) class.
- every class in java extends a Object class - (only the parent class, child class will automatically inherit it through parent class).
- this() - this method calls the default constructor of same class - and that default constructor will call the default constructor of
    super class.

method overloading 
- same method name, different parameter list

method overriding
- when child and parent class both has method with same name - method of child class overrides method of parent class

Access Modifiers 
- public - if you want to access something outside the package - make it public.
- private - private variables can be used only in same class.
- default - can be accessed in same package.
- protected - accessible by - same package, child classes (even in other packages).

Polymorphism
- Same line of code — different output — depending on the object inside it.
- 2 types - 
    - 1. compile time - overloading
    - 2. run time - overriding

Dynamic Method Dispatch
- Java decides which overridden method to run at runtime based on the object — not the reference type
- class Animal {
    void sound() {
            System.out.println("Animal sound");
        }
    }
    class Dog extends Animal {
        void sound() {
            System.out.println("Dog barks");
        }
    }
    Animal a = new Dog();
    a.sound();
- O/P - Dog barks
- Because at runtime, Java looks at actual object → Dog - and dispatches Dog’s version.

Final
- same as const in c++ and java, its value can not be changed.
